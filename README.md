# Bankist - Modern Banking Website

Bankist is a responsive banking web app developed as part of my Full JavaScript course. The project focuses on implementing real-world banking operations like money transfers, loans, and account management in a modern, minimalist interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Seamless user experience across different devices.
- **User Authentication**: Log in to view your personal account dashboard.
- **Account Summary**: Real-time balance updates, summary of deposits, withdrawals, and interest earned.
- **Money Transfers**: Easily transfer money between users.
- **Loan Request**: Instant loan approval if deposit conditions are met.
- **Account Closure**: Users can easily close their accounts.
- **Auto-Logout**: Users are logged out automatically after a period of inactivity for security.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort transactions by date or amount.
  
## Project Flow

The app follows a clear process as illustrated by the flowchart:

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in with correct credentials to access the app's features.
2. **Account Operations**: Users can:
   - Transfer money to other users.
   - Request loans, subject to specific conditions.
   - Close their accounts with proper authentication.
3. **UI Updates**: The app dynamically updates the user interface to show current balances, movements, and summary statistics after any operation.
4. **Logout Mechanism**: Users are logged out after inactivity, ensuring session security.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For creating the structure and styling of the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic behavior, event handling, and user interactions.
- **Local Storage**: Session management using local storage for temporary data.
